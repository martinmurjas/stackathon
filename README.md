# Barrel It Up

A simple app designed to analyze and grade a person's baseball swing mechanics

### 5 Simple Steps

- Upload a video of yourself (or someone else) taking a swing
  - For best results, video should be
    - Taken from belt height and perpendicular to the batter's stance and shoulders
    - Recorded with a high frame rate so the video can be played in slow motion
    - The ball being hit should be belt high down the middle of the plate (if using a tee, place the tee slightly in front of the plate)
- Select the starting point for analysis which should be when the front foot touches down onto the ground following the leg kick
- Select the ending point for analysis which is the moment the bat makes contact with the ball (ball should be slightly in front of home plate)
- Select which side of the plate the batter is batting from (right vs left)
- Click the start button for analysis
